ore conversion? something similar to matter?

We could use the arcofolders for unique resource folding which can convert some resources into a specific intermediate, which can then be turned into other resources.
We could even have two tiers, one for raw resource folding, and then one for second stage resources (iron plates, copper plates, steel plates, stone brick)
