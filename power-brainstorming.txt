So basically itâ€™s a loop of 8 special boilers
Each of them with a different recipe
The first recipe:
Takes:
  5x every mc arco
  hot potato 1
  1000 water
Gives:
  45 McDonald arcos
  hot potato 2
  1000 super hot steam
The second recipe:
Takes:
  5x every mc arco
  hot potato 2
  1000 water
Gives:
  45 Walmart arcos
  hot potato 3
  1000 super hot steam
All the way until the 8th recipe:
Takes:
  5x every mc arco
  hot potato 8
  1000 water
Gives:
  45 KFC arcos
